# React mortgage calculator

This project was mainly for me to learn some React. Due to me having some react stuff to do at work.

Used this FreeCodeCamp project as a guide: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-mortgage-calculator-tutorial-for-beginners/

I learnt a little about useState but everything else is pretty self explanitary. I will try build these features and learn some more, hoepfully. Or I'll just go back to Ruby on Rails and use Hotwire.

This project is fully deployed on Netlify for free. Here's a link: https://main--taupe-axolotl-fc0008.netlify.app/
